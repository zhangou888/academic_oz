I am a model analyst at [USAA](https://www.usaa.com/). My research interests include applied statistics, data visualization, machine learning, general data science, and psychometrics. My current work mainly focuses on data science, psychometrics modeling, statistical analysis, testing development, and consulting. 

I received my PhD in Educational Research, Evaluation, and Methodology from [University of Florida](http://www.ufl.edu/) in 2012. 

Prior to joining USAA, I was a research scientist (2017-2020) at Pearson Psychometrics Service and Psychometrician II and team lead (2012-2017) at clinical assessment branch in Pearson. While at clinical branch, I led multiple flagship clinical assessment products, including WISC-5, GFTA-3, KLPA-3, Quotient ADHD diagnosis test, TEACH-2 Behavior test. 

Outside of data science and applied statistics, I am also a programming lover, a sports fan, and a father of two wonderful kids.
