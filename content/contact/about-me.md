I am originally from Chengdu, China and am a CDUTer from [Chendu University of Technology](https://www.cdut.edu.cn/). 

After college, I studied psychology, psychometrics, and quantitative methods, receiving my MEd. from [Boston College](https://www.bc.edu/) (2007), and Ph.D. from [University of Florida](https://www.uf.edu/) (2012). 

I am now a data scientist and psychometrician at [Pearson Psychometrics Service](https://www.pearson.com/). 
Prior to that, I was an psychometrician II and team lead at [Pearson Clinical Assessment](https://www.pearsonassessments.com/professional-assessments.html), and research fellow at [Assessment and Program Evaluation Services, University of Florida](https://education.ufl.edu/capes/).

My [research](https://www.github.com/zhangou888) mainly focuses on data science, psychometrics (i.e., MIRT, equating, norming), statistical modeling, and testing development.

I have written numerous scientific [publications](/publication) on psychometrics, test equating, norming and have presented my research at over 10 international conferences.

While at UF, I became an enthusiastic coder including R, Python, and SAS, both in the lab as a research fellow and in the classroom as a teaching assistant. 
I developed a passion for programming and data science, and during my tenure at Pearson I developed and gave talks on multiple 
[training seminars](/categories/talks/).

You can follow my current work for [My projects on GitHub](https://github.com/zhangou888). 

In my free time, I love watching and participating in all types of sportsâ€“football, basketball, baseball, soccer, swimming, etc.
