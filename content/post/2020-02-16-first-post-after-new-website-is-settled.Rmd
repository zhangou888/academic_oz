This is the first post I created after my personal website is set. 

This is the 2nd time I've built my personal website. Last time, I was in graduate school still. 

Today is Sunday 2-16-2020. 
This morning Alex and I went to our local team's soccer game to cheer up my teammate and experience the true soccer game after weeks of his first soccer shot training. 

Unfortunately, I got injured a week before, hitting by a 300 lbs guy with full speed on my chest. So, I couldn't dressed up and played today. But **our team won 4:1.** Yeah! Alex really enjoy watching the game and played soccer with Daddy on the sideline.

Alex and I had a great time this morning. We kicked soccer ball back and forth. Alex made a couple of good shots to the goal. I am so proud of him.

Alex really enjoy playing soccer! I wish he improves his skill fast.
