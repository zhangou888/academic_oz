<p>This is the first post I created after my personal website is set.</p>
<p>This is the 2nd time I’ve built my personal website. Last time, I was in graduate school still.</p>
<p>Today is Sunday 2-16-2020.
This morning Alex and I went to our local team’s soccer game to cheer up my teammate and experience the true soccer game after weeks of his first soccer shot training.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I got injured a week before, hitting by a 300 lbs guy with full speed on my chest. So, I couldn’t dressed up and played today. But <strong>our team won 4:1.</strong> Yeah! Alex really enjoy watching the game and played soccer with Daddy on the sideline.</p>

<p>Alex and I had a great time this morning. We kicked soccer ball back and forth. Alex made a couple of good shots to the goal. I am so proud of him.</p>
