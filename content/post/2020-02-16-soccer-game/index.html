<p>Today is Sunday 2-16-2020.</p>
<p>This morning Alex and I went to a soccer game to cheer up my teammate and experience the true soccer game after weeks of his soccer training from a local soccer training institute-Soccer Shots.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I was injured a week before, hitting by a 300-pound guy with full speed on my chest.
So, I couldnâ€™t dress-up and play today. But <strong>our team won 4:1.</strong> in a beautiful way!
Alex really enjoyed watching the game and played soccer with his Daddy on the sideline.</p>

<p>Alex and I had a great time this morning. We kicked soccer ball back and forth. Alex made a couple of good shots.
I am so proud of him.</p>

<p>Alex really enjoy playing soccer! I wish he improves his skill fast and becomes a good soccer athelete like his daddy.</p>
