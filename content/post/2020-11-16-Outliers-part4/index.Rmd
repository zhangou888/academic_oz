In my last blog, I've discussed the outliers detection in regression ([part 3](/2020/11/09/outliers-part3/)). In fact, outliers in regression is a special case of the multivariate outliers. Because regression has been widely used, I choose to make it as a special topic. 

Now, in this part I am going to discuss how the **multivariate outliers** are detected in a general way. 

In this post, a linear regression example is still used, but the outlier detection methods we apply are in a multivariate way. 


> Multivariate Statistics - Simultaneous observation and analysis of more than one outcome variable.

# Data Source

The `Animals` data from the `MASS` package in R is selected for demonstration.

```{r data1}

# Load library and pull out data
library(MASS)
data(Animals)

attach(Animals)

# check data structure.
head(Animals)

```
## Variables in Data

The variables for the demonstration are **body weight** and **brain weight** of Animals which are converted to its `log form` (to make highly skewed distributions less skewed)

```{r data_convert}

# Log transformation.
Y <- data.frame(body = log(Animals$body), 
                brain = log(Animals$brain))

# Create Scatterplot
plot_fig <- ggplot(Y, aes(x = body, y = brain)) + 
            geom_point(size = 5) +
                       xlab("log(body)") + 
                       ylab("log(brain)") + 
                       ylim(-5, 15) +
            scale_x_continuous(limits = c(-10, 16), breaks = seq(-15, 15, 5))

plot_fig

```

In the multivariate world, outliers can be defined as particularly **influential observations**. 

 > An outlier is an observation which deviates so much from the other observations as to arouse suspicions that it was generated by a different mechanism.‚Äù  -- D. M. Hawkins 

Most multivariate outlier detection methods rely on the computation of some _distance metric_, and the observations greater than a **certain threshold** are considered outliers. 

Importantly, outliers detection methods are meant to provide information to the researcher, rather than being an automatized procedure which mindless application is a substitute for thinking. 

Again, outlier detection and handling is still a **subjective process** from researcher. It varies based on different research goals, perspectives, and theoretical frameworks. 

Using the composite approach, multivariate outliers are obtained via the joint application of multiple outliers detection algorithms listed below:

  - Mahalanobis distance 
  - Robust Mahalanobis distance  
  - Minimum Covariance Determinant  
  - Invariant Coordinate Selection
  - OPTICS
  - Isolation Forest 
  - Local Outlier Factor

# Model-specific methods

Prior to the general multivariate outlier detection method introduction, it is worth mentioning a couple of model-specific methods. 

## Cook's Distance
Among outlier detection methods, Cook's distance and leverage are less common than the basic **Mahalanobis distance**, but still used. Cook's distance estimates the variations in regression coefficients after removing each observation, one by one (Cook, 1977). Since Cook's distance is in the metric of an F distribution with p and n-p degrees of freedom, the median point of the quantile distribution can be used as a cut-off (Bollen, 1985). A common approximation or heuristic is to use `4 divided by the numbers of observations`, which usually corresponds to a lower threshold (i.e., more outliers are detected). This only works for Frequentist models. For more Cook's Distance information, please refer my previous blog ([part 3](/2020/11/09/outliers-part3/)).

## Pareto  
Pareto is a coefficient used for for Bayesian models. The reliability and approximate convergence of Bayesian models can be assessed using the estimates for the shape parameter $k$ of the generalized Pareto distribution. If the estimated tail shape parameter k exceeds `0.5`, the user should be warned, although in practice the authors of the loo package observed good performance for values of $k$ up to `0.7` (the default threshold used by performance).


# Multivariate methods

## Mahalanobis Distance  
**Mahalanobis distance** (Mahalanobis, 1930) is often used for multivariate outliers detection as this distance takes into account the shape of the observations. 

Mahalanobis (or generalized) distance for observation is the **distance from this observation to the center**, _taking into account the covariance matrix_.


```{r fig2, out.width='60%', fig.align='center', fig.pos='h', fig.cap='Outliers',echo = FALSE}

    knitr::include_graphics("figure/mahalanobis.png", error = FALSE)

```
### Details about Mahalanobis Distance    
- Classical Mahalanobis distances: sample mean as estimate for location and sample covariance matrix as estimate for scatter.

- To detect multivariate outliers the Mahalanobis distance is compared with a cut-off value, which is derived from the `chi-square distribution`

- In two dimensions we can construct corresponding `97.5%` tolerance ellipsoid, which is defined by those observations whose Mahalanobis distance does not exceed the cut-off value.

The `default threshold` is often arbitrarily set to some deviation (in terms of SD or MAD) from the mean (or median) of the Mahalanobis distance. However, as the Mahalanobis distance can be approximated by a `Chi-squared distribution` (Rousseeuw & Van Zomeren, 1990), we can use the `alpha quantile` of the chi-square distribution with `k` degrees of freedom ($k$ being the number of columns). 

By default, the `alpha threshold` is set to `0.025` (corresponding to the **2.5%** most extreme observations; Cabana, 2019). This criterion is a natural extension of the median plus or minus a coefficient times the MAD method (Leys et al., 2013).


```{r mahalanobis}

Y_center <- colMeans(Y)
Y_cov <- cov(Y)
Y_radius <- sqrt(qchisq(0.975, df = ncol(Y)))
library(car)
Y_ellipse <- data.frame(ellipse(center = Y_center,
                                shape = Y_cov,radius = Y_radius, 
                                segments = 100, draw = FALSE))

colnames(Y_ellipse) <- colnames(Y)

plot_fig <- plot_fig +
  geom_polygon(data=Y_ellipse, color = "dodgerblue",
               fill = "dodgerblue", alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_point(aes(x = Y_center[1], y = Y_center[2]),
             color = "blue", size = 6)
plot_fig

```

As you can observed from the plot graph above, Mahalanobis Distance method gives us `3` potential outlier observations, which are close to the ellipse line.

The `maha_dist` function from `{assertr}` computes mahalanobis distance for each row of data frame. This function will return a vector, with the same length as the number of rows of the provided data frame, corresponding to the average mahalanobis distances of each row from the whole data set.

```{r maha_dist}
library(assertr)
maha_dist(mtcars)

maha_dist(iris, robust=TRUE)

mtcars %>%
  insist_rows(maha_dist, within_n_mads(10), everything())
  ## anything here will run

```


## Robust Mahalanobis Distance
A robust version of Mahalanobis distance using an Orthogonalized Gnanadesikan-Kettenring pairwise estimator (Gnanadesikan \& Kettenring, 1972). 
`check_outliers` function in `{performance}` package has 'Robust Mahalanobis Distance' option. The `bigutilsr` package is required to apply this option.

Meanwhile, the `maha_sparse` function in `{DiPs}` package creates a robust Mahalanobis distance for matching based on a sparse network.

```{r maha_sparse}

# load library
library(DiPs)

# pull data source
data("nh0506Homocysteine")
attach(nh0506Homocysteine)

X <- cbind(female,age,black,education,povertyr,bmi)
p <- glm(z~female+age+black+education+povertyr+bmi,family=binomial)$fitted.values
d <- cbind(nh0506Homocysteine,p)
detach(nh0506Homocysteine)

# Apply symmetric caliper 0.15 on propensity score
dist1<-maha_sparse(d$z,X,p,0.15)
length(dist1$d)

# apply asymmetric caliper c(-0.2,0.1) on propensity score
dist2 <- maha_sparse(d$z,X,p,c(-0.2,0.1))
length(dist2$d)

```

You can also plot the Robust Mahalanobis distance through `plot.mcd` function from `{rrcov}` package. `plot.mcd` function shows the **Mahalanobis distance** based on **robust** and **classical** estimates of the location and the covariance matrix in different plots.

```{r plot.mcd}
# load library.
library(rrcov)
data(hbk)
hbk.x <- data.matrix(hbk[, 1:3])
datamcd <- CovMcd(hbk.x)

rrcov::plot(datamcd)

```

## Minimum Covariance Determinant (MCD)
Another robust version of Mahalanobis. Leys et al. (2018) argue that Mahalanobis Distance is not a robust way to determine outliers, as it uses the means and covariances of all the data ‚Äì including the outliers ‚Äì to determine individual difference scores.

Minimum Covariance Determinant calculates the mean and covariance matrix based on the most central subset of the data (by default, `66%`), before computing the Mahalanobis Distance. This is deemed to be a more robust method of identifying and removing outliers than regular Mahalanobis distance.

 1. MCD looks for those `h` observations whose classical covariance matrix has the lowest possible determinant.
 2. MCD estimate of location is then mean of these `h` observations
 3. MCD estimate of scatter is a sample covariance matrix of these `h` points (multiplied by consistency factor).
 4. The re-weighting step is applied to improve efficiency at normal data.
 5. The computation of MCD is difficult, but several fast algorithms are proposed.
 
```{r mcd}

Y_mcd <- robustbase::covMcd(Y)
# Robust estimate of location
Y_mcd$center
# Robust estimate of scatter
Y_mcd$cov

```
By plugging in these robust estimates of location and scatter in the definition of the Mahalanobis distances, we obtain **robust distances** and can create a **robust tolerance ellipsoid (RTE)**. 

### robust tolerance ellipsoid (RTE)

```{r rte}

Y_mcd <- robustbase::covMcd(Y)
ellipse_mcd <- data.frame(car::ellipse(center = Y_mcd$center,
                                  shape = Y_mcd$cov,
                                  radius= Y_radius, 
                                  segments=100,draw=FALSE))
colnames(ellipse_mcd) <- colnames(Y)
plot_fig <- plot_fig +
  geom_polygon(data=ellipse_mcd, color="red", fill="red", 
  alpha=0.3) +
  geom_point(aes(x = Y_mcd$center[1], y = Y_mcd$center[2]),
             color = "red", size = 6)
plot_fig

```
### Distance-Distance plot
The distance-distance plot shows the robust distance of each observation versus its classical Mahalanobis distance, obtained immediately from MCD object.

```{r dd_plot}

robustbase::plot(Y_mcd, which = "dd")

```

## Invariant Coordinate Selection (ICS)
The outlier are detected using ICS, which by default uses an alpha threshold of `0.025` (corresponding to the `2.5%` most extreme observations) as a cut-off value for outliers classification. The ICS coefficient can be calculated through `ics.outlier()` function from `{ICSOutlier}`. Please refer to the help-file of [ICSOutlier::ics.outlier()](https://rdrr.io/cran/ICSOutlier/man/ics.outlier.html) to get more details about this procedure. Note that `method = "ics"` requires both `ICS` and `ICSOutlier` to be installed, and that it takes some time to compute the results.

```{r ics}
library(ICSOutlier)

# Example of no outlier
set.seed(123)
X = matrix(rweibull(1000, 4, 4), 500, 2)
X = apply(X,2, function(x){ifelse(x<5 & x>2, x, runif(sum(!(x<5 & x>2)), 5, 5.5))}) 
icsX <- ics2(X)
icsOutlierAG <- ICSOutlier::ics.outlier(icsX, test = "anscombe", 
                                        level.dist = 0.01, 
				                                level.test = 0.05, 
				                                mDist = 100, ncores = 1)
summary(icsOutlierAG)
plot(icsOutlierAG)
rm(.Random.seed)
  

```


## OPTICS
The Ordering Points To Identify the **Clustering Structure (OPTICS)** algorithm (Ankerst et al., 1999) is using similar concepts to **DBSCAN** (an unsupervised clustering technique that can be used for outliers detection). The threshold argument is passed as minPts, which corresponds to the minimum size of a cluster. By default, this size is set at 2 times the number of columns (Sander et al., 1998). Compared to the others techniques, that will always detect several outliers (as these are usually defined as a percentage of extreme values), the `check_outliers` function in `{performance}` package in a different manner and won't always detect outliers. Note that `method = "optics"` requires the **dbscan** package to be installed, and that it takes some time to compute the results.

## Isolation Forest
The outliers are detected using the anomaly score of an isolation forest (a class of random forest). The default threshold of `0.025` will classify as outliers the observations located at `qnorm(1-0.025) * MAD`) (a robust equivalent of SD) of the median (roughly corresponding to the `2.5%` most extreme observations). Requires the solitude package.

## Local Outlier Factor
Based on a `K` nearest neighbours algorithm, LOF compares the local density of an point to the local densities of its neighbors instead of computing a distance from the center (Breunig et al., 2000). Points that have a substantially lower density than their neighbors are considered outliers. A LOF score of approximately 1 indicates that density around the point is comparable to its neighbors. Scores significantly larger than 1 indicate outliers. The default threshold of `0.025` will classify as outliers the observations located at $qnorm(1-0.025) \times SD$) of the log-transformed LOF distance. Requires the `dbscan` package.

# 'check_outliers' function in {performance} R package

The `check_outliers` function in the `{performance}` package (L√ºdecke et al., 2019) contains multiple composite outlier score detection methods and is worthy of mention. 

You can find the function details from the below link.

[check_outliers](https://easystats.github.io/performance/reference/check_outliers.html)

In this function, all the default thresholds are set as below.

```{r check_outliers}

library(performance)

# Univariate
check_outliers(mtcars$mpg)
#> Warning: 4 outliers detected (cases 18, 19, 20, 28).
#> 

# Multivariate
# select only mpg and disp (continuous)
mt1 <- mtcars[, c(1, 3, 4)]
# create some fake outliers and attach outliers to main df
mt2 <- rbind(mt1, data.frame(mpg = c(37, 40), disp = c(300, 400), hp = c(110, 120)))
# fit model with outliers
model <- lm(disp ~ mpg + hp, data = mt2)

ol <- check_outliers(model)
# plot(ol)
insight::get_data(mode)[ol, ]
#> Warning: Could not get model data.
#> NULL


check_outliers(model, method = c("mahalabonis", "mcd"))
#> Warning: 6 outliers detected (cases 18, 20, 28, 31, 33, 34).
#> 
if (FALSE) {
# This one takes some seconds to finish...
check_outliers(model, method = "ics")

# For dataframes
check_outliers(mtcars)
check_outliers(mtcars, method = "all")
}

```


### Threshold specification
```{r Threshold}
# list of default Threshold specification. 
list(zscore = stats::qnorm(p = 1 - 0.025), 
     iqr = 1.5, 
     cook = stats::qf(0.5, ncol(x), nrow(x) - ncol(x)), 
     pareto = 0.7,
