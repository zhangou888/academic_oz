abstract = "This study investigated the factorial invariance of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fifth Edition (WISC-V) between samples of male and female children. A higher-order 5-factor model was tested on a nationally-representative sample of 2200 children aged 6 to 16 years. The results demonstrated full factorial invariance between genders. The WISC-V subtests demonstrate the same underlying theoretical latent constructs, the same strength of relationships among factors and subtests, the same validity of each first-order factor, and the same communalities, regardless of the gender, thus supporting the same interpretive approach and meaningful comparisons of the WISC-V between male and female children.
