This repository contains all the useful resources I used for the logistic regression for my 2013 department training workshop.

You can find my training document from the link above. This material simply lay out:

1. How we conduct logistic regression;
2. How the ROC curve is produced in PROC LOGISTIC;
3. Different statistical tests included in the PROC LOGISTIC module. 

I also include a couple of SAS code examples for your information. 

This repo is for Clinical Assessment statistical analysts training purpose only.
